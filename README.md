# EchoHub

Nonverbal individuals have to bridge a gap when communicating. To aid their ability to communicate, we propose an iOS application called EchoHub that integrates with smart home assistants. EchoHub will allow nonverbal users to partner with their choice of home assistant, assign pictures to actionable commands, and have their home assistant execute these commands for them so that they can have greater independence in their daily life. While nonverbal individuals donâ€™t communicate through speech, they can synthesize outside information and express their needs through writing, typing, or physical cues; however, they rely on intermediate individuals to translate their form of communication into an actionable outcome. EchoHub cuts out the middleman and allows users to have greater independence in their daily life.

## Installation
